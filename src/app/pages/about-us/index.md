    There are currently 56 Community Councils within Argyll and Bute, covering
    every geographical area from Cardross in the east to the island of Tiree in
    the west.


    Community Councils are the first or the “grass roots” tier of statutory representation in Scotland. They bridge the gap between local authorities and communities, and help ensure that public authorities are aware of the opinions and needs of the communities they represent.


    While their primary statutory purpose is to represent the views of their community to the local authority and other public bodies, most Community Councils also involve themselves in a wide range of other activities which might include fundraising for local projects, running community and educational events, or organising environmental projects.


    Here at Garelochhead we have the option to elect up to sixteen community councillors. These must include three office bearers in the form of Convenor, Treasurer and Secretary.


    Our AGM is usually around June and our elections around November, this format allows any interested people to be co-opted on in June giving them time to decide if the role is for them before they run for election. If, and when an individual is successful he or she can go on a Governance training course. This teaches us our roles and responsibilities.
